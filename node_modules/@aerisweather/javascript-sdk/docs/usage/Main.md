The AerisWeather JavaScript SDK is an easy-to-use library that allows developers to quickly integrate weather data and imagery from their Aeris subscription into their web applications. You can perform basic Aeris Weather API and/or Aeris Maps Platform (AMP) requests, or display a fully-interactive weather map using one of the many third-party mapping libraries currently supported.

Follow our [Getting Started](./getting-started) guide to quickly add weather data and imagery to your web applications.


## Requirements + Compatibility
- Requires an active [AerisWeather subscription](https://www.aerisweather.com/signup/pricing/) to the AerisWeather API and/or Aeris Maps Platform (AMP)
- Compatible with modern browsers and IE 11*

{{class::prose-sm}}* Using the NPM module requires transpiling in your build system for ES5 support.{{/class}}

### Basic Request Example
The following is a basic example demonstration how easy it is to start using the AerisWeather JavaScript SDK for requesting AerisWeather API data and AMP imagery once you're [setup](./getting-started/):

```javascript
// load the latest observation for Seattle, WA
aeris.api().endpoint('observations').place('seattle,wa').get().then((result) => {
     const data = result.data.ob;
     document.getElementById('obs').innerHTML = `The current weather is ${data.weatherPrimary.toLowerCase()} and ${data.tempF} degrees.`;
});

// load the latest radar image for Seattle, WA at 500x300 pixels
aeris.map().layers('flat,radar,counties,admin').center('seattle,wa').zoom(9).size(500, 300).get().then((result) => {
     // append result image to a DOM target
     document.getElementById('map-target').appendChild(result.image);
     
     // output image valid time to a DOM target
     document.getElementById('map-metadata').innerHTML = `Valid: ${result.metadata.validDate}`;
});
```

### Implementation Methods
The AerisWeather JavaScript SDK can be implemented either [in the browser](./getting-started/script-usage/) by loading the compiled library from our CDN, or by installing and importing the SDK as an [NPM module](./getting-started/module-usage/) and importing it into your NodeJS or JavaScript project. Review the [Getting Started](./getting-started/) guide for more information about each implementation and and to setup and start using the SDK.

## Features
The AerisWeather JavaScript SDK offers a rich feature set, from basic data and map imagery requests to fully-functional static and interactive weather maps. The core features of the SDK are outlined below:

| Feature | |
|---|---|
| **Data Requests** | Configure and request data from the Aeris Weather API. [Read more](./requesting-data-maps/requesting-data/) about API data requests via the SDK. |
| **Map Image Requests** | Configure and request map imagery from the Aeris Maps Platform (AMP). [Read more](./requesting-data-maps/requesting-maps/) about map requests via the SDK. |
| **Interactive Map** | A fully-interactive weather map using one of several support third-party mapping libraries, including [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/), [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org) and [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/). [Read more](./interactive-map/) about setting up an interactive map with the SDK. |
| **Map View** | A lightweight weather map using static Aeris Maps imagery that supports animating weather data. [Read more](./map-view/) about setting up an basic map view with the SDK. |
| **Legends** | An easy-to-use view component for fetching and rendering one or more weather layer legends in association with map imagery from the Aeris Maps Platform (AMP). [Read more](./legends/) about using legends within the SDK. |
