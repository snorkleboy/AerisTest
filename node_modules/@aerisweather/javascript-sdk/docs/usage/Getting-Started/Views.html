<h1 id="views-module" class="page-title">Views Module</h1>
<p>When implementing the AerisWeather JavaScript SDK using the core <a href="/docs/js/classes/aerisweather.html"><code>AerisWeather</code></a> public interface, the library is broken into three separate modules: (1) the core library and data/map requests functionality, (2) core map and legend views, and (3) feature rich applications.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the library file size, the <strong>Views</strong> module is loaded separately at runtime and only if your code requires access to one or more of the built-in views, such as the <a href="/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-js-sdk/interactive-map/">interactive map</a> or <a href="/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-js-sdk/map-view/">map view</a>. The <strong>Views</strong> module public interface is accessed via the <a href="/docs/js/classes/aerisweather.html#views"><code>views()</code></a> method on your <code>AerisWeather</code> instance and is only loaded whenever you access this method for the first time. Therefore, if you only need the core requests functionality in your project, the <strong>Views</strong> module is never loaded.</p>
<p class="alert alert-info">When using any of the built-in view components that are part of the SDK, you will also need to import the corresponding stylesheets in either raw SASS or precompiled CSS files depending on your usage. Refer to the <a href="../script-usage/">script usage</a> or <a href="../module-usage/">NPM module</a> setup documentation for information regarding importing the necessary stylesheet from the SDK.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-the-views-module">Working With the Views Module</h3>
<p>While all of this happens automatically within the SDK, you should be aware of how this affects instantiation of view-related components. The library’s <strong>Views</strong> module is loaded asynchronously using the <a href="/docs/js/classes/aerisweather.html#views"><code>views()</code></a> method, which means you’ll need to wait for it to be loaded before working with any of its features. You can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promise</a> that’s returned, or provide a callback function as a parameter to <code>view()</code> which is called once the module is loaded:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// load the Views module using with Promise
aeris.views().then((views) =&gt; {
    // &quot;views&quot; in this context is the public interface you&#39;ll use
    // to create your views
});

// load the Views module with a callback function
aeris.views((views) =&gt; {
    // &quot;views&quot; in this context is the public interface you&#39;ll use
    // to create your views
});</code></pre>
<p>Once the <strong>Views</strong> module is loaded, you can then create instances of <a href="/docs/js/classes/interactivemap.html"><code>InteractiveMap</code></a> or <a href="/docs/js/classes/mapview.html"><code>MapView</code></a> using the module’s <a href="/docs/js/modules/views.html">public interface</a> returned to your callback through the <code>views</code> argument.</p>
<p>For instance, the following code would setup the SDK and add an instance of <code>InteractiveMap</code> to the page:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>const aeris = new AerisWeather(&#39;CLIENT_ID&#39;, &#39;CLIENT_SECRET&#39;);
aeris.views().then((views) =&gt; {
    const map = new views.InteractiveMap(&#39;#ia-map&#39;, {
        strategy: &#39;leaflet&#39;,
        zoom: 4,
        layers: &#39;satellite,radar&#39;
    });
});</code></pre>
<h3 id="views-using-an-npm-module">Views Using an NPM Module</h3>
<p>Working with the <strong>Views</strong> module when using our NPM module for the SDK is similar to the above, except that you would need to import the core <code>AerisWeather</code> entry point to setup the SDK with your Aeris account credentials:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>import aeris from &#39;@aerisweather/javascript-sdk&#39;;

const aeris = new AerisWeather(&#39;CLIENT_ID&#39;, &#39;CLIENT_SECRET&#39;);
aeris.views().then((views) =&gt; {
    const map = new views.InteractiveMap(&#39;#ia-map&#39;, {
        strategy: &#39;leaflet&#39;,
        zoom: 4,
        layers: &#39;satellite,radar&#39;
    });
});</code></pre>
<p>However, when using the SDK as <a href="/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-js-sdk/getting-started/module-usage/">modules</a> instead of the <a href="/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-js-sdk/getting-started/script-usage/">compiled script</a>, you have the option of importing individual modules from the library and instantiating objects directly. In this case, you don’t need to use the primary <a href="/docs/js/classes/aerisweather.html"><code>AerisWeather</code></a> entry point for the SDK. This means you also don’t have to worry about loading the <strong>Views</strong> module asynchronously as you control how the SDK is packaged into your final product.</p>
<p>For instance, you may want to use an <a href="/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-js-sdk/interactive-map/">interactive map</a> in your existing JavaScript project that is already setup using NPM and webpacker. You may setup your file similar to:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>import InteractiveMap from &#39;@aerisweather/javascript-sdk/maps/interactive/InteractiveMap&#39;;

const target = document.getElementById(&#39;map&#39;);
const map = new InteractiveMap(target, {
     // map configuration
});</code></pre>
