<h1 id="getting-started" class="page-title">Getting Started</h1>
<p>Getting started with the AerisWeather JavaScript SDK requires that you have an active Aeris account and have determined which <a href="#script-usage-vs-npm-module">implementation method</a> you wish to use as detailed below.</p>
<h2 id="start-using-the-sdk">Start Using the SDK</h2>
<p>You’ll need to follow a series of steps to get started using the AerisWeather JavaScript SDK:</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>Sign up for an AerisWeather API subscription service and setup your access keys as described in our Aeris Weather API’s getting started guide. We offer a free developer account for you to give our weather API a test drive.</li>
	<li>Decide on your method of integration, either by loading the SDK <a href="./script-usage">in the browser</a> or using it as an <a href="./module-usage">NPM module</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="script-usage-vs-npm-module">Script Usage vs NPM Module</h2>
<p>The AerisWeather JavaScript SDK supports both browser-based inclusion and NodeJS module implementations depending on your project’s needs. In most cases, using the browser-based include method is the recommended method as it offers the fastest and easiest setup. However, if you’re building your application using NPM libraries or with a NodeJS server that doesn’t require a browser, then the NodeJS module would work.</p>
