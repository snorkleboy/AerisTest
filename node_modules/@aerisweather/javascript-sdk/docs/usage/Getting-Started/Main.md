# Getting Started {.page-title}
Getting started with the AerisWeather JavaScript SDK requires that you have an active Aeris account and have determined which [implementation method](#script-usage-vs-npm-module) you wish to use as detailed below.

## Start Using the SDK
You'll need to follow a series of steps to get started using the AerisWeather JavaScript SDK:

1. Sign up for an AerisWeather API subscription service and setup your access keys as described in our Aeris Weather API's getting started guide. We offer a free developer account for you to give our weather API a test drive.
2. Decide on your method of integration, either by loading the SDK [in the browser](./script-usage) or using it as an [NPM module](./module-usage).

## Script Usage vs NPM Module
The AerisWeather JavaScript SDK supports both browser-based inclusion and NodeJS module implementations depending on your project's needs. In most cases, using the browser-based include method is the recommended method as it offers the fastest and easiest setup. However, if you're building your application using NPM libraries or with a NodeJS server that doesn't require a browser, then the NodeJS module would work.

| Browser Script | NPM Module |
|---|---|
| Easier to get started | Requires more setup to get started |
| Already compiled to support ES5+ | Must setup up a module bundler for browser usage |
| Limited library access using facade methods | Full access to library classes and utilities |
| Must include entire script files regardless of usage | More control over which classes and features are included in your project |
