# Legend Panel

An [interactive map application]({{base-url}}/interactive-map-app/) contains a legend panel component, which displays and manages a [`LegendView`]({{docs-url}}/classes/legendview.html) based on the map content sources active on the interactive map. By default, a legend panel is toggleable and collapsed since it's secondary information and can overlap large visible regions of the interactive map depending on the active layers and viewport size.

## Configuration
The following options are supported when configuring your [LegendPanel]({{docs-url}}/classes/legendpanel.html) instance:

{{table:table-props}}

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| legend | `object` | Configuration for the [legend view]({{docs-url}}/classes/legendview.html). Refer to the [Legend View]({{base-url}}/legends/) usage documentation for the list of supported configuration options and defaults. | |
| title | `string` | Label title for the panel. The title is only rendered if the panel is toggleable and in the expanded state. | |
| className | `string` | A CSS class name to add to the panel, which can be used for additional style customizations. | |
| toggleable | `boolean` | A boolean value indicating whether the panel is toggleable. A toggleable panel will display a button in the closed/collapsed state initially. Clicking on the button will expand the panel to its full size. | `true` |
| icon | `string` | Icon HTML to display in the button when the panel is collapsed. This value can be any valid HTML, including an `<img>` or `<svg>` element. | |
| position | `object` | Options to configure the position of the panel within its parent container. | |
| position.pin | `string` | The position to pin the panel to relative to its parent container. Supports `topleft`, `top`, `topright`, `left`, `center`, `right`, `bottomleft`, `bottom`, or `bottomleft`. | |
| position.translate | [`IPoint`]() | Amount to translate the panel in the x and y axis relative to its pinned position. | `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` |

### Default Configuration
The following is the default configuration object for a [LegendPanel]({{docs-url}}/classes/legendpanel.html) instance:

```javascript
{
    legend: {
        size: {
            width: 300
        },
        styles: {
            label: {
                color: '#ffffff'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
