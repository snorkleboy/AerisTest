# Timeline Panel

An [interactive map application]({{base-url}}/interactive-map-app/) contains a timeline panel component, which displays the map timeline's current time that data is rendered for as well as allows the user to go to a different time within the timeline's range.

## Configuration
The following options are supported when configuring your [TimelinePanel]({{docs-url}}/classes/timelinepanel.html) instance:

{{table:table-props}}

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| range | `object` | Configuration for the range slider component. | |
| range.title | `string` | Title to render above the component. | |
| range.width | `number` | Width of the slider bar. | |
| range.value | `number[]` | Initial value of the component as an array of numbers, where the first value represents the minimum value in the range, and the second value represents the maximum value. **Note:** When used within the context of [InteractiveMapApp]({{base-url}}/interactive-map-app/), any time range defined for the [map's timeline directly]({{base-url}}/interactive-map/configuration/) will supersede the range value defined here. | |
| range.range | `{ min: number; max: number; }` | Allowed minimum and maximum values for the range. | |
| range.marksEvery | `number` or `string` | Interval to automatically render labels based on the `step` and range values. If a number is provided, labels will be rendered based on the index, or count, of the step within the range (e.g., a value of `12` will render labels every twelfth (12th) step. If a string is provided and is prefixed with a percent sign (%), then labels will be rendered for steps whose values are evenly divisible by the defined value (e.g., a value of `% 12` will render labels for step values divisible by 12). | |
| range.marks | `object` | Labels to display along the slider, where the key is the value within the range and the value is the label string to display. The keys defined within `range.marks` will override any automatically generated labels when used in conjunction with `range.marksEvery`. | |
| range.step | `number` | Interval between snapped values. | |
| range.tooltip | `boolean` or `Function` | A boolean value indicating whether a tooltip should appear while a slider handle is pressed, or a function that returns the tooltip content to display based on the value passed to the function. | |
| title | `string` | Label title for the panel. The title is only rendered if the panel is toggleable and in the expanded state. | |
| className | `string` | A CSS class name to add to the panel, which can be used for additional style customizations. | |
| toggleable | `boolean` | A boolean value indicating whether the panel is toggleable. A toggleable panel will display a button in the closed/collapsed state initially. Clicking on the button will expand the panel to its full size. | `false` |
| icon | `string` | Icon HTML to display in the button when the panel is collapsed. This value can be any valid HTML, including an `<img>` or `<svg>` element. | |
| position | `object` | Options to configure the position of the panel within its parent container. | |
| position.pin | `string` | The position to pin the panel to relative to its parent container. Supports `topleft`, `top`, `topright`, `left`, `center`, `right`, `bottomleft`, `bottom`, or `bottomleft`. | |
| position.translate | [`IPoint`]() | Amount to translate the panel in the x and y axis relative to its pinned position. | `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` |

### Default Configuration
The following is the default configuration object for a [TimelinePanel]({{docs-url}}/classes/timelinepanel.html) instance:

```javascript
{
    range: {
        title: 'Time Range <span>(hours)</span>',
        width: 300,
        range: {
            min: -24,
            max: 24
        },
        marksEvery: '% 12',
        marks: {
            0: 'Now'
        },
        step: 3,
        tooltip: (value: number): string => {
            if (value === 0) {
                return 'Now';
            }
            const prefix = value > 0 ? '+' : '';
            return `${prefix}${value} hours`;
        }
    },
    toggleable: false
}
```
