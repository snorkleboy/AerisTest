<h1 id="managing-a-map-view" class="page-title">Managing a Map View</h1>
<p>Once you have created an instance of <a href="">‘MapView’</a>, you can perform various updates to the view at runtime even after the map has been rendered. All changes to a map view must be performed using the map’s underlying configuration manager, which is accessible using the <a href="/docs/js/classes/mapview.html#config">‘config’</a> property of your <code>MapView</code> instance. This property will return the associated <a href="/docs/js/classes/mapconfig.html"><code>MapConfig</code></a> instance that is currently managing the map view. Therefore, you will be accessing this configuration object when manipulating your map view after initialization.</p>
<h3 id="layer-groups">Layer Groups</h3>
<p>A map view divides its layers into four separate groups, each having their own container on the map:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>base</code>: Base layers, which will be rendered at the bottom of the layer stack.</li>
	<li><code>data</code>: Weather data layers, which will be rendered above base layers but below overlay layers.</li>
	<li><code>overlays</code>: Overlay layers, which will be rendered above data layers.</li>
	<li><code>text</code>: Text layers, which will be rendered at the top of the layer stack.</li>
</ul>
<p class="alert alert-info">Note: It is recommended to use the default vaule of <code>combined</code>, which is <code>false</code>, as it will reduce the number of map units used with your map view. By not combining all layers into a single image, base and overlay layers will only need to be requested once when the map is initially rendered or if you update them using <code>setBase()</code> or <code>setOverlays()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="managing-layers">Managing Layers</h2>
<p>Map views support a wide array of layers and are added to a map using the supported layer codes. These layer codes correspond to those currently <a href="https://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/aeris-maps/reference/map-layers/">offered through the Aeris Maps Platform (AMP)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="setting-weather-layers">Setting Weather Layers</h3>
<p>As outlined above, layers are grouped by category which also determines where they are added in the layer stack on your map. Weather-related layers correspond to the <strong>data</strong> group. Therefore, to update the weather layers for your map view you will need to use the <a href="/docs/js/classes/mapconfig.html#setdata"><code>config.setData()</code></a> method, passing an array of layers codes:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>map.config.setData([&#39;satellite&#39;, &#39;radar&#39;]);</code></pre>
<p>You can also use layer modifiers or masks with the layers provided:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>map.config.setData([&#39;temperatures:80&#39;, &#39;water-flat&#39;, &#39;radar&#39;]);</code></pre>
<h3 id="handling-forecast-layers">Handling Forecast Layers</h3>
<p>Some weather layers have a corresponding forecast layer associated with it, such as temperatures, wind speeds and radar. By default, forecast layers are automatically added to your map view if your map timeline’s range extends into the future and the layer has a corresponding forecast layer. You can disable this by setting your map view’s <code>autoFuture</code> <a href="../configuration/">configuration</a> property to <code>false</code>, which means you will need to add and remove forecast layers manually instead.</p>
<p>For example, if you have <code>autoFuture</code> enabled, your timeline extends into the future and add the <code>radar</code> layer to your map, then the <code>fradar</code> will also be added since it’s the forecast radar layer:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// update the timeline to end 2 hours from now
map.timeline.setEndOffset(2 * 3600);

// add &quot;radar&quot;, which will also add &quot;fradar&quot; automatically
map.config.setData([&#39;radar&#39;]);</code></pre>
<p>This will result in a seemless animation between past and future radar data since the map view will automatically show or hide each layer’s container depending on whether it’s past or future data and the timeline’s position.</p>
<p>If you want to continue showing past layers in the future or future layers in the past, simply set the <code>alwaysShowPast</code> and/or <code>alwaysShowFuture</code> <a href="../configuration/">configuration options</a> to <code>true</code> for your map view. Enabling these are useful if you want to show daily min/max temperatures without having to adjust the map timeline’s playhead position:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>const map = new views.Map(document.getElementById(&#39;mapview&#39;), {
    map: {
        layers: {
            data: [&#39;ftemperatures-max-text&#39;, &#39;ftemperatures-max&#39;]
        },
        center: &#39;minneapolis,mn&#39;,
        zoom: 6
    },
    animation: {
        alwaysShowFuture: true
    }
});</code></pre>
<h3 id="changing-base-overlay-layers">Changing Base &amp; Overlay Layers</h3>
<p>You map view’s base and overlay layers can be changed after initialization as well. To do so, use the <a href="/docs/js/classes/mapconfig.html#setbase"><code>config.setBase()</code></a> and <a href="/docs/js/classes/mapconfig.html#setoverlays"><code>config.setOverlays()</code></a> methods.</p>
<p>For instance, the following would update the map view’s base layer and overlays to dark versions:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>map.config.setBase([&#39;flat-dk&#39;]).setOverlays([&#39;counties-dk:50&#39;, &#39;admin-dk&#39;]);</code></pre>
<h2 id="updating-a-map-configuration">Updating a Map Configuration</h2>
<p>Once a map view has been rendered, its configuration can be modified using the view’s underlying <a href="/docs/js/classes/mapconfig.html"><code>MapConfig</code></a> instance via the <code>config</code> property accessor on your map view. From here you can change the map’s center, bounds, size and more.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="/docs/js/classes/mapconfig.html"><code>MapConfig</code></a> API documentation for the full list of methods available for manipulating your map view.</p>
