# Map View {.page-title}

A Map View is a simple weather map that displays and manages a series of Aeris Maps (AMP) layers and imagery. This view also handles animating weather data layers across a specific time range. The major difference between this Map View and the [Interactive Map]({{base-url}}/interactive-map/) is that this view does not support user interactions, such as panning, zooming or selecting markers and other map elements.

### Getting Started
Getting started with a map view is quick and easy. Simply follow the [Getting Started]({{base-url}}/getting-started/) guide for the JavaScript SDK to get setup if you haven't already done so.

{{alert-info}}The map view feature is part of the **Views** module of the library. Therefore, you'll need to use the `views()` method on your `AerisWeather` instance in order to begin using any of the map view-related features. [Read more]({{base-url}}/getting-started/views-module/) about working with the **Views** module.{{/alert-info}}

Initialize your weather map view with your DOM target where it will be rendered and desired [configuration options](./configuration/) using `new views.Map(target, opts)` constructor. For example, the following will render a weather map in the DOM target with id `mapview` centered on Austin, TX with radar and alerts layers and a size of 800x600:

```javascript
// using Promises
aeris.views().then((views) => {
    const map = new views.Map('#mapview', {
        map: {
            layers: {
                data: 'alerts,radar'
            },
            center: 'austin,tx',
            zoom: 6,
            size: {
                width: 800,
                height: 600
            }
        }
    }
});
```

Alternatively, if you're providing a callback function to the `views()` method:

```javascript
// using callback function
aeris.views((views) => {
    const map = new views.Map('#mapview', {
        map: {
            layers: {
                data: 'alerts,radar'
            },
            center: 'austin,tx',
            zoom: 6,
            size: {
                width: 800,
                height: 600
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Adding and Removing Weather Data
Adding and removing weather layers once you've created your map instance is simple. All you need is the layer code associated with the layer you want to add, which is typically the same as the [Aeris Maps (AMP) layer code](/support/docs/aeris-maps/reference/map-layers/).

Refer to the [Managing Layers](./managing-layers/) documentation for more information on adding and removing layers with your map view.

## Animating Weather Data
A map's animation is controlled by a single [timeline](./timeline/), which is responsible for animating map data across a time period. The timeline will have a starting and ending date and time and only data within that time range will appear on the map.

To begin playing a map animation, use `play()` on the map's `timeline` property:

```javascript
map.timeline.play();
```

Stopping an animation is similar, except using the `stop()` method on the timeline:

```javascript
map.timeline.stop();
```

You can also check if the map timeline is currently animating, which is useful to create a simple animation toggle function for a button click event handler:

```javascript
const btnToggle = document.getElementById('btn-toggle');
btnToggle.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (map.timeline.isAnimating()) {
        map.timeline.stop();
    } else {
        map.timeline.play();
    }
});
```

Refer to the [Timeline](./timeline/) documentation for more information on configuring your map's date range and its animation.

## Map Controls and Overlays
A `MapView` instance also supports adding custom controls and overlays to your view, such as a title bar or controls allowing a user to switch the map layers or region dynamically.

Refer to the [Overlays](./overlays/) and [Map Controls](./map-controls/) documentation for more information on customizing these features of your map view.
