<h1 id="map-timeline" class="page-title">Map Timeline</h1>
<p>Weather maps support displaying and animating weather data by using a time-based timeline, meaning a timeline with a specific start and end date. This means that you can configure your weather map to display data for a specific period in time in the past, future or both.</p>
<p>All active data sources visible on the map will be animated as long as those sources support it. Some data sources, specifically some shape/polygon-based data sources, don’t currently support animating their data. However, nearly all raster/image and point data sources are animatable.</p>
<p>By default a weather map animation will repeat indefinitely with a longer delay at the end of the timeline before restarting from the beginning. An animation’s speed is controlled by both the maximum number of intervals allowed, specifically for raster/image data sources, and the timeline’s date range. Since each data source and map layer has differing update intervals and periods, each data source will animate independent of each other. Thus, the total number of intervals may vary between the different data sources within a single animation.</p>
<p class="alert alert-info">Note that by default a map will only display past/current data for past/current timeline intervals and future data for future timeline intervals. However, you can change this behavior. See the <a href="#always-showing-past-andor-future-data">Always Showing Past and/or Future Data</a> section below for more information.</p>
<h3 id="defining-a-time-range">Defining a Time Range</h3>
<p>When you instantiate your weather map, it’s setup using the default weather map configuration or with <a href="../configuration/">custom configuration options</a> you provide. This configuration object also configures the initial state of the map’s timeline, such as the start and end dates or times and the number of intervals to show while animating along the timeline.</p>
<p>You specify the start and end dates or times for your map’s timeline in your configuration by using time offsets relative to the current date and time when the map is initialized, in seconds. For instance, the default timeline configuration specifies a start time two (2) hours before the current time and an end time equal to the current time (offset of <code>0</code>):</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>timeline: {
    from: -2 * 3600,
    to: 0
}</code></pre>
<p class="alert alert-info">Note that these offset values must be provided in seconds.</p>
<p>The start and end dates or time intervals can either be in the past or future. However, there are some requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The starting date/time offset must always be earlier than the ending date/time offset.</li>
	<li>The ending date/time offset must always be later than the starting date/time offset.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also update the timeline after the map has already been initialized. Use the <code>setStartOffset()</code> and <code>setEndOffset()</code> methods, providing the offsets in seconds relative to now:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>aeris.views().then(views =&gt; {
    const map = new views.InteractiveMap(&#39;#map&#39;, {
        timeline: {
            from: -2 * 3600,
            to: 0
        }
    });
    map.on(&#39;ready&#39;, () =&gt; {

        // update the timeline to start 6 hours ago
        map.timeline.setStartOffset(-6 * 3600);

        // update the timeline to end 2 hours from now
        map.timeline.setEndOffset(2 * 3600);

    });
});</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, instead of offset time values you can also set the timeline range using dates using <code>setStartDate()</code> and <code>setEndDate()</code>, whose values can be <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"><code>Date</code></a> objects or a number corresponding to the Epoch time in milliseconds:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>aeris.views().then(views =&gt; {
    const map = new views.InteractiveMap(&#39;#map&#39;, {
        timeline: {
            from: -2 * 3600,
            to: 0
        }
    });
    map.on(&#39;ready&#39;, () =&gt; {

        // update the timeline start and end using dates
        const start = new Date(2018, 10, 20, 17);
        const end = new Date(2018, 10, 23, 17);
        
        map.timeline.setStartDate(start);
        map.timeline.setEndDate(end);

    });
});</code></pre>
<p>Updating the start and/or end dates on your map’s timeline will stop any active animation and update the data sources currently active on the weather map as needed to account for the time range change.</p>
<h3 id="controlling-the-animation-speed">Controlling the Animation Speed</h3>
<p>You can speed up or slow down an animation from the default of two (2) seconds by configuring the <code>duration</code> timeline option. This value should be set to the number of seconds you want it to take to complete a single iteration of an animation loop. Use a higher number to slow down the animation, and use a lower number to speed an animation up.</p>
<p>Additionally, an animation also includes a delay at the end of each iteration before restarting the animation from the beginning using the <code>endDelay</code> configuration option. By default this value is set to one (1) second. Adjust this option on your timeline configuration to increase or decrease the amount of time the last animation frame is held before restarting.</p>
<p>For example, the following timeline configuration would set the animation duration to five (5) seconds and hold the last frame to three (3) seconds:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>aeris.views().then(views =&gt; {
    const map = new views.InteractiveMap(&#39;#map&#39;, {
        timeline: {
            duration: 5,
            endDelay: 3
        }
    });
});</code></pre>
<h3 id="showing-a-specific-time">Showing a Specific Time</h3>
<p>A weather map’s timeline also supports going to a specific time within its range, allowing you to display weather data for a particular point in time. Just use the <code>goToTime()</code> method on the map’s timeline instance and provide the <code>Date</code> or a number corresponding to the Epoch time in milliseconds:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>aeris.views().then(views =&gt; {
    const map = new views.InteractiveMap(&#39;#map&#39;, {
        timeline: {
            from: -2 * 3600,
            to: 0
        }
    });
    map.on(&#39;ready&#39;, () =&gt; {

        // get the current time offset for the start position
        const from = map.timeline.from;

        // move the timeline position to 1 hour after the beginning, or 1 hour ago
        map.timeline.goToTime(from + 3600);

    });
});</code></pre>
<h3 id="start-animating-when-the-map-is-ready">Start Animating When the Map is Ready</h3>
<p>You may want to start playing the map’s animation immediately when the map has been loaded and setup. To do so, just tell the animation to play within an event handler for the map’s <a href="../events/"><code>ready</code> event</a>:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>aeris.views().then(views =&gt; {
    const map = new views.InteractiveMap(&#39;#map&#39;, {
        timeline: {
            from: -2 * 3600,
            to: 0
        }
    });
    map.on(&#39;ready&#39;, () =&gt; {

        // start animating immediately when the map is ready
        map.timeline.play();

    });
});</code></pre>
<h3 id="always-showing-past-andor-future-data">Always Showing Past and/or Future Data</h3>
<p>By default, an interactive map will only show past/current data (radar, satellite, alerts, observations, etc) for current timeline intervals and those in the past. As such, a map will only show future data (such as forecasts, outlooks, etc) for future timeline intervals.</p>
<p>You may, however, want to always show past data for future intervals and/or future intervals for past data. This is often useful if you want to display an animation consisting of future data, such as future radar or forecast temperatures, that constains time intervals in the past relative to now.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, you just need to set the necessary <code>alwaysShowPast</code> and/or <code>alwaysShowFuture</code> properties on your map’s timeline configuration object. For instance, the following will always render future layers for timeline intervals in the past:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>aeris.views().then(views =&gt; {
    const map = new views.InteractiveMap(&#39;#map&#39;, {
        timeline: {
            from: -12 * 3600,
            to: 6 * 3600,
            alwaysShowFuture: true
        }
    });
});</code></pre>
<p>Note that most layers which represent observations or past data, such as current temperatures or road conditions, aren’t available for future time intervals and will result in invalid requests. Therefore, you’ll most likely only use the <code>alwaysShowFuture</code> option.</p>
