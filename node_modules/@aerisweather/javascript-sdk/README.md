# AerisWeather JavaScript SDK
The AerisWeather JavaScript SDK is an easy-to-use library that allows developers to quickly intergrate weather data and imagery from their Aeris subscription into their web applications. You can perform basic Aeris Weather API and/or Aeris Maps Platform (AMP) requests, or display a fully-interactive weather map using one of the many third-party mapping libraries currently supported.
